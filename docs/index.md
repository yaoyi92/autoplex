`autoplex` is a software tool for the automated generation and benchmarking of machine learning (ML)-based interatomic potentials. 
The aim of autoplex is to provide a fully automated solution for creating high-quality ML potentials. 
The software is interfaced to multiple different ML potential fitting frameworks and to the atomate2 and ase environment 
for efficient high-throughput computations. 
The vision of this project is to allow a wide community of researchers to create accurate and reliable ML potentials for materials simulations.
