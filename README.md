`autoplex` is still under very active development and is only suitable for expert users as not all of the documentation is in place. This will change until end of November 2024.

`autoplex` is a software for generating and benchmarking machine learning (ML)-based interatomic potentials. The aim of `autoplex` is to provide a fully automated solution for creating high-quality ML potentials. The software is interfaced to multiple different ML potential fitting frameworks and to the atomate2 and ase environments for efficient high-throughput computations. The vision of this project is to allow a wide community of researchers to create accurate and reliable ML potentials for materials simulations.

`autoplex` is developed jointly by two research groups at BAM Berlin and the University of Oxford.

`autoplex` is an evolving project and **contributions are very welcome**! To ensure that the code remains of high quality, please raise a pull request for any contributions, which will be reviewed before integration into the main branch of the code. Initially, [@JaGeo](https://github.com/JaGeo) will handle the reviews.

# Workflow overview

We currently have two different types of automation workflows available:

* Workflow to use random-structure searches for the systematic construction of interatomic potentials: [arXiv: 10.48550/arXiv.2412.16736](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16736).
  The implementation automates ideas from the following articles: [*Phys. Rev. Lett.* **120**, 156001 (2018)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.156001) and [*npj Comput. Mater.* **5**, 99 (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-019-0236-6).
* Workflow to train accurate interatomic potentials for harmonic phonon properties. The implementation automates the ideas from the following article: [*J. Chem. Phys.* **153**, 044104 (2020)](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/153/4/044104/1056348/Combining-phonon-accuracy-with-high).


## Documentation

You can find the `autoplex` documentation [here](https://autoatml.github.io/autoplex/index.html)!
The documentation also contains tutorials that teach you how to use `autoplex` for different use cases for the RSS and phonon workflows and individual modules therein.

## What to cite?

Please cite our preprint on the random-structure searches (RSS) performed with `autoplex`:

# Before you start using `autoplex`

We expect the general user of `autoplex` to be familiar with the [Materials Project](https://github.com/materialsproject) framework software tools and related
packages for (high-throughput) workflow submission and management.
This involves the following software packages:
- [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen) for input and output handling of computational materials science software,
- [atomate2](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2) for providing a library of pre-defined computational materials science workflows,
- [jobflow](https://github.com/materialsproject/jobflow) for processes, job and workflow handling,
- [jobflow-remote](https://github.com/Matgenix/jobflow-remote) or [FireWorks](https://github.com/materialsproject/fireworks) for workflow and database (MongoDB) management,
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database (we recommend installing the MongoDB community edition). More help regarding the MongoDB installation can be found [here](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/installation.html#install-mongodb).

All of these software tools provide documentation and tutorials. Please take your time and check everything out! Please also cite the software packages if you are using them!

## Setup

To set up the mandatory prerequisites for using `autoplex,` please follow the [installation guide of atomate2](https://materialsproject.github.io/atomate2/user/install.html).

After setting up `atomate2`, make sure to add `VASP_INCAR_UPDATES: {"NPAR": number}` in your `~/atomate2/config/atomate2.yaml` file.
Set a number that is a divisor of the number of tasks you use for the VASP calculations.

# Installation

## Python version

Before the installation, please make sure that you are using one of the supported Python versions (see [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/autoatml/autoplex/blob/main/pyproject.toml))

## Standard installation

Please install `autoplex` using
```
pip install autoplex[strict]
```
This will install all the Python packages and dependencies needed for MLIP fits.

Additionally, to fit and validate `ACEpotentials`, one also needs to install Julia, as `autoplex` relies on [ACEpotentials](https://acesuit.github.io/ACEpotentials.jl/dev/gettingstarted/installation/), which supports fitting of linear ACE. Currently, no Python package exists for the same.
Please run the following commands to enable the `ACEpotentials` fitting options and further functionality.

Install Julia v1.9.2

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh -s -- default-channel 1.9.2
```

Once installed in the terminal, run the following commands to get Julia ACEpotentials dependencies.

```bash
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.Registry.add("General"); Pkg.Registry.add(Pkg.Registry.RegistrySpec(url="https://github.com/ACEsuit/ACEregistry")); Pkg.add(Pkg.PackageSpec(;name="ACEpotentials", version="0.6.7")); Pkg.add("DataFrames"); Pkg.add("CSV")'
```

## Enabling RSS workflows

Additionally, `buildcell` as a part of `AIRSS` needs to be installed if one wants to use the RSS functionality:

```bash
curl -O https://www.mtg.msm.cam.ac.uk/files/airss-0.9.3.tgz; tar -xf airss-0.9.3.tgz; rm airss-0.9.3.tgz; cd airss; make ; make install ; make neat; cd ..
```

Please find out about licenses and citation requirements here: [https://airss-docs.github.io/](https://airss-docs.github.io/)

## LAMMPS installation

You only need to install LAMMPS, if you want to use J-ACE as your MLIP.
Recipe for compiling lammps-ace including the download of the `libpace.tar.gz` file:

```
git clone -b stable_29Aug2024_update1 https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git
cd lammps
mkdir build
cd build
wget -O libpace.tar.gz https://github.com/wcwitt/lammps-user-pace/archive/main.tar.gz

cmake  -C ../cmake/presets/clang.cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=on -D BUILD_MPI=yes \
-DMLIAP_ENABLE_PYTHON=yes -D PKG_PYTHON=on -D PKG_KOKKOS=yes -D Kokkos_ARCH_ZEN3=yes \
-D PKG_PHONON=yes -D PKG_MOLECULE=yes -D PKG_MANYBODY=yes \
-D Kokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=yes -D BUILD_OMP=yes -D LAMMPS_EXCEPTIONS=yes \
-D PKG_ML-PACE=yes -D PACELIB_MD5=$(md5sum libpace.tar.gz | awk '{print $1}') \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$LAMMPS_INSTALL -D CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS:STRING="-lgfortran" \
../cmake

make -j 16
make install-python
```

$LAMMPS_INSTALL is the conda environment for installing the lammps-python interface.
Use `BUILD_MPI=yes` to enable MPI for parallelization.

After the installation, enter the following commands in the Python environment.
If you get the same output, it means the installation was successful.

```python
from lammps import lammps; lmp = lammps()
```
```bash
LAMMPS (29 Aug 2024 - Update 1)
OMP_NUM_THREADS environment is not set. Defaulting to 1 thread. (src/comm.cpp:98)
  using 1 OpenMP thread(s) per MPI task
>>>
```
It is very important to have it compiled with Python (`-D PKG_PYTHON=on`) and
LIB PACE flags (`-D PACELIB_MD5=$(md5sum libpace.tar.gz | awk '{print $1}')`).
